How to reload page once pug data is changed.
Save css Sprite in memory instead of tmp folder.
Background URL Variable instead of ../../
Be able to change the order of JS file injection to HTML
Do I need [path] for this line? { test: /\.(jpg|png)$/, loader: 'file?name=[path][name].[ext]', include: Paths.images  },  This will affect to css background URL. Removed for now



-- Notice

** Webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin
Common Chunks js that were used by this plugin should be loaded first. 
Usually Commons Chunks JS should contain Other libraries so that require('sameLibrary') in other js file won't add same libraries' code again.
CommonChunks will remove common liblary code in other js file before they are generated as specified format. ( [name].js or bundle.js )
